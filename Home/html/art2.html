    <!-- Article Content -->
    <p>Think you know everything about recycling? You may be surprised by the common misconceptions that could be sabotaging your best efforts. Let's bust the top myths about recycling and uncover the truths that can help you recycle smarter and reduce waste more effectively.</p>

    <h2>1. Myth: You Don’t Need to Rinse Containers Before Recycling</h2>
    <p>Many believe that recyclables don’t need to be clean before going into the bin. However, food residue can contaminate entire batches of recyclables, rendering them unusable. Rinsing containers before recycling is essential to ensure materials are accepted and processed properly.</p>
  
    <h2>2. Myth: All Plastics Can Be Recycled</h2>
    <p>While many plastics are labeled with a recycling symbol, not all are recyclable through curbside programs. Most programs accept only #1 and #2 plastics (e.g., water bottles and milk jugs). Items like plastic bags, straws, and polystyrene foam (Styrofoam) often require special handling or are not recyclable at all.</p>

    <h2>3. Myth: Recycling Costs More Than It’s Worth</h2>
    <p>Some believe that recycling is too costly or energy-intensive to be beneficial. While recycling does have associated costs, it typically uses less energy and resources than producing new materials from raw resources. Over time, recycling can lead to significant environmental and economic savings.</p>
  
    <h2>4. Myth: Glass Cannot Be Recycled</h2>
    <p>Glass is one of the most recyclable materials, yet many people mistakenly believe it is not accepted. Most curbside programs do accept glass bottles and jars, although some regions may have separate collection methods due to glass’s weight and potential to break. Always check your local guidelines.</p>
  
    <h2>5. Myth: One Person’s Recycling Efforts Don’t Make a Difference</h2>
    <p>A common myth is that individual actions don’t impact the larger waste issue. However, every small action contributes to the overall effort. When more people recycle correctly, it reduces landfill waste, conserves resources, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Collectively, small steps lead to big change.</p>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Knowledge is power in recycling. Understanding the realities behind these myths can help you make smarter decisions that positively impact the environment. By adopting mindful recycling habits and spreading awareness, you can inspire others to take action, too. Together, we can debunk myths and pave the way for a greener, cleaner future.</p>
